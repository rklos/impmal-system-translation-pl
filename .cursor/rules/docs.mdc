# Documentation Rules

You are creating documentation for a FoundryVTT module translation project. All documentation must be consistent, simple, and practical.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Use clear, straightforward language suitable for junior developers
- **Consistency**: Follow the same structure, terminology, and style across all docs
- **No Duplication**: Each piece of information should exist in exactly one place
- **Practicality**: Focus on what users need to do, not theory
- **Brevity**: Keep explanations concise and to the point

## File Structure

### Existing Files

- `docs/README.md` - Main documentation index and navigation hub
- `docs/translation-guide.md` - Core translation workflow and guidelines
- `docs/package-development.md` - Package creation and management
- `docs/patching-system.md` - Template modification system
- `docs/custom-package.md` - Custom functionality guidelines

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case (e.g., `translation-guide.md`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Keep names short but meaningful

## Standard Document Structure

Every document should follow this exact structure:

```markdown
# Title

Brief one-paragraph description of what this document covers.

## Overview (if needed)

High-level explanation when the topic requires context.

## Main Content Sections

Organized by topic, not by technical implementation.

## Troubleshooting (if applicable)

Common issues table with Problem | Solution columns.

## Related Documentation

Links to related docs using relative paths.
```

## Formatting Rules

### Headings

- Use `#` for document title (only one per document)
- Use `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Use `####` sparingly, only when necessary
- Never skip heading levels
- Keep headings short and descriptive

### Code Blocks

- Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Use `bash` for terminal commands
- Use `json` for configuration examples
- Use `typescript` for code examples
- Keep code examples minimal and focused

### Lists

- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.` for ordered lists (numbered steps)
- Keep list items concise
- Use bold for key terms: `- **Key term**: Brief explanation`

### Tables

- Use tables for structured data (command references, troubleshooting)
- Keep tables simple with 2-3 columns maximum
- Always include header row

```markdown
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Issue description | How to fix it |
```

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal documentation links
- Format: `[Display Text](filename.md)`
- Place related documentation links at the end of the document

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Write in second person ("you") when giving instructions
- Use present tense
- Use active voice
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (define it if used)
- One idea per sentence
- One topic per paragraph

### Instructions

- Start action items with a verb
- Number sequential steps
- Include expected outcomes where helpful
- Show command examples in code blocks

### Examples

- Provide practical, real-world examples
- Keep examples minimal but complete
- Annotate complex examples with comments

## Section Templates

### Command Reference

```markdown
## Commands

### Command Name

```bash
npm run command-name
```
